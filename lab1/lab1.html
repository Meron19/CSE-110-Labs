        <p>Create a new section (styled the same as the first section), with a 4-column grid of text boxes (with a gap of 25px, centered). For each box, set the background-color to #182b49 and the font color to white, and set a max-height of 500px with an overflow of scroll. This will display multiple scrollable elements. Feel free to refer to how Slack’s homepage creates a 4-column grid (pictured below) and this documentation for aid with grids.</p>
